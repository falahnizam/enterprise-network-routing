# Enterprise Network Routing Project

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure, scalable multi-site enterprise network across four locations: **London**, **Leicester**, **Liverpool**, and **Leeds**.

## Overview
- Designed and tested using Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Implemented **OSPF dynamic routing** with **static failover**  
- Configured **VLAN segmentation** (Finance, Executive, Employees)  
- Set up **DHCP** for automated IP assignment  
- Applied **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to restrict internet access  
- Secured all routers and switches with **SSH, password encryption, and port security**

## Features
- âœ… Dynamic and static routing redundancy  
- âœ… VLAN-based traffic segmentation  
- âœ… DHCP address automation  
- âœ… Centralized internet access control  
- âœ… Device hardening and port shutdowns for unused interfaces  

## Technologies Used
- Cisco IOS CLI  
- OSPF Protocol (Single-area configuration)  
- VLANs, Trunking, Router-on-a-Stick  
- DHCP Server Configuration  
- Access Control Lists (ACL)  
- SSH, Password Encryption  

##  Key Learning Outcomes
- Enterprise topology planning and subnetting with VLSM  
- Router configuration and link verification
- switch configuration
- Security best practices in enterprise environments
